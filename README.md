# Creative Computing for Atmospheric Memory

>A breathtaking interactive art environment where you can see, hear and even touch the sounds that travel through the atmosphere.

>Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s Atmospheric Memory scours the sky for the voices of our past.

Technology has an immense hold in our lives as humans and artists, we need technology to go about our everyday life with ease. Technology has a lot of benefits but also seems to have a lot of downfalls. We are living in a time in which we as people are obsessed with ‘absolute recollection’ and using technology to capture every moment possible. We want to capture every event and moment and act and impression that we see. Atmospheric Memory explores the idea that the atmosphere itself is an archive and is a ‘vast library holding very word ever spoken’. 

[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer](https://www.instagram.com/lozanohemmer/) is a Mexican-Canadian electronic artist that has a Bachelor of Science in Physical Chemistry. Lozano-Hemmer creates platforms for public participation using technologies such as:

- Robotic Lights
- Digital Fountains
- Computerised Surveillance
- Media Walls
- Telematic Networks
- Robotics
- Real-time computer graphics
- Film Projections
- Positional Sound
- Internet Links
- Cell phone Interfaces
- Video and ultrasonic sensors
- LED Screens

## Charles Babbage ##

>*The air itself is one vast library on whose pages are for ever written all that man has ever said or woman whispered.*
>
>Charles Babbage (1837)

In order to understand Lozano-Hemmer’s [Atmospheric Memory](https://atmosphericmemory.com), you have to first start with where he drew his inspiration to create this new art environment. Computing Pioneer Charles Babbage’s 180-year-old-proposal that the air is a *vast library* holding every word ever spoken was the basis for the installation that comprises a series of artworks and *atmospheric machines* that transform and shape the air into something that can be seen, heard and even touched. 

Babbage attempted to show how mathematics and computational thinking could help to reveal the nature of the divine in the organisations of the cosmos, which was incredibly ahead of its time in 1837. Babbage even became close to painting a picture of God as a computer programme; *a divine being with a cosmic machine that set the universe in motion.* The wider argument contains ideas such as his discussion of movements and sounds imprinted within the atoms of the atmosphere surrounding us. 

## Atmospheric Memory at MIF ##

As soon as I began researching creative computing, Lozano-Hemmer’s installation came to mind as it harnessed *both state-of-the-art technology and **phantasmagorical** effects*. His *Atmospheric Machines* mine for air turbulence caused by speech and in turn transform these into something we can see, hear and touch; through trails of vapour, ripples on water and larger than life 360 degree projections. Other technologies and works within this installation included a polyphonic tunnel upon entry as a means of getting into the custom built chamber which featured thousands of separate sound channels. 

Atmospheric Memory was commissioned by Manchester International Festival and the Science and Industry Museum as part of **[Manchester International Festival 2019.](https://mif.co.uk)** I visited the exhibtion in July 2019 when it was premiered.

#### Full Breakdown of the Atmospheric Memory Artworks and Atmospheres displayed inside the Atmospehric Memory Chamber ####

**[Atmosphonia](https://youtu.be/lcs5TpfvSMw)**

Sound environment featuring 3,000 audio channels on custom-made speakers with LED lights. In this tunnel, recordings change typology every metre: starting with wind, then water, fire, ice, over 200 types of insects, over 300 types of birds, bells, bombs and so on.

**[Cloud Display](https://youtu.be/N2bODJtqpSU)**

Text display with 1,600 ultrasonic atomizers, controlled by voice recognition system. This display writes any words spoken into an intercom using pure water vapour. The atomizers are typically used for cold water humidifiers. In Manchester the system is set to recognize different accents in the English language from single words to full sentences.

**Voice Tank**

Ripple tank controlled by polyphonic pitch detection actuation. The voices of two participants who speak into the intercoms are analyzed and converted into notes hammered by motorized components. The resulting waves interact creating unique patterns.

**[Weather Vanes](https://youtu.be/zFp0AEQCJqU)**

Pneumatic turbulence generator controlled by Mel-frequency cepstrum voice analysis. This piece features 99 brass arrows inspired by anemometers and weather vanes, the devices used to measure wind speed and direction. Here the live voices control miniature computerized fans that create turbulence. When seen from above the table looks like a map of wind barbs or vectors.

**Vocal Folds**

Laryngoscopic video, LED display, computer, speakers, oil drums. Five Northern actors agreed to read Babbage’s Ninth Bridgewater Treatise during an endoscopic filming. A camera was introduced into their nose, reaching their vocal folds and cords.

**[Flag Beacon](https://youtu.be/IDXNmxNAwTI)**

Robotic light beacon, controlled by voice root mean square power. A point of light rotates around the room in exactly one minute. The intensity of the dot is inversely proportional to the volume of the participant’s voice. After releasing the intercom button an echo is heard from past recordings.

**Last Breath**

Mechanical respirator circulating the breath of composer Pauline Oliveros. A brown paper bag inflates and deflates 10,000 times a day, the normal respiratory frequency for an adult at rest. The bag contains the breath of Avant Garde American composer Pauline Oliveros, developer of the concept of “Deep Listening”. Oliveros died on Nov 24, 2016 but her breath continues circulating in this biometric portrait.

**Volute 1**

Speech bubble, printed in steel, capturing the air turbulence ejected as a sentence is spoken. Made with laser tomography scans (shown in video), photogrammetry and 3D printing. The phrase chosen was “Au clair de la lune” — the first ever human voice recorded by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville in 1860, seventeen years before Edison’s.

**Babbage Nanopamphlets**

Two million specks of gold were engraved using nanotechnology techniques at Cornell University. Around 50,000 copies were sprayed in the original exhibition room so they remained floating around in the air, potentially inhaled by the public. These engravings are 150 atoms thick and are biologically inert so pose no health risk. The rest of the pamphlets are shown suspended in water in a vial with a magnetic stirrer. The text engraved onto the gold leaflets is an excerpt from “On the permanent Impression of our Words and Actions on the Globe we inhabit”, chapter IX of Charles Babbage’s Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. A first edition of the book is shown here along with electron microscope imagery of the leaflets.

**Text Stream**

The full text of the collected works of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace turned into a stream of letters.

**Airborne Projection**

Heat map shadow play, controlling Navier-Stokes fluid-dynamics algorithm.

**Clouds 1**

Artificial vapour waves.

**Voice Tank**

Live video stream from Voice Tank.

**Clouds 2**

Artificial vapour waves.

**Weather Vanes**

Live video stream from Weather Vanes.

**Clouds 3**

Atrificial vapour waves. 

**Vanishing Points**

Superposition of perspective grids.

**Zoom Pavillion**

Surveillance piece using movement and face detection, records visitors’ spatial relationship within the exhibition space. *Collaboration with Krzysztof Wodiczko.*

**Recognition**

Machine-learning face recognition system classifies the viewer in relation to a database of people who have seen the work in the past.  

**Stand in**

Drone video sequence from Atmospheric Memory Chamber.

**Text Stream 2**

The full text of the collected works of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace turned into a stream of letters.

## Reflection ##

To conclude, I initially thought that I wouldn’t like this project as I am *really* not a fan of coding and complex computer things. However I approached it with an open mind and much to my surprise I have really enjoyed it. It’s a lot less about the computer coding and much more about using these elements combined with design to create an outcome that showcases technology as art. Throughout my research, I have developed an even keener interest in Creative Computing used for exhibitions, installations and immersive spaces. I have always loved this aspect of design and have always been drawn to it so it has been very interesting learning about some of the processes behind the art.
