# Creative Computing for Atmospheric Memory

>A breathtaking interactive art environment where you can see, hear and even touch the sounds that travel through the atmosphere.

>Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s Atmospheric Memory scours the sky for the voices of our past.

Technology has an immense hold in our lives as humans and artists, we need technology to go about our everyday life with ease. Technology has a lot of benefits but also seems to have a lot of downfalls. We are living in a time in which we as people are obsessed with ‘absolute recollection’ and using technology to capture every moment possible. We want to capture every event and moment and act and impression that we see. Atmospheric Memory explores the idea that the atmosphere itself is an archive and is a ‘vast library holding very word ever spoken’. 

Rafael Lozano-Hemmer is a Mexican-Canadian electronic artist that has a Bachelor of Science in Physical Chemistry. Lozano-Hemmer creates platforms for public participation using technologies such as:

- Robotic Lights
- Digital Fountains
- Computerised Surveillance
- Media Walls
- Telematic Networks
- Robotics
- Real-time computer graphics
- Film Projections
- Positional Sound
- Internet Links
- Cell phone Interfaces
- Video and ultrasonic sensors
- LED Screens

## Charles Babbage ##

>*The air itself is one vast library on whose pages are for ever written all that man has ever said or woman whispered.*
>
>Charles Babbage (1837)

In order to understand Lozano-Hemmer’s Atmospheric Memory, you have to first start with where he drew his inspiration to create this new art environment. Computing Pioneer Charles Babbage’s 180-year-old-proposal that the air is a *vast library* holding every word ever spoken was the basis for the installation that comprises a series of artworks and *atmospheric machines* that transform and shape the air into something that can be seen, heard and even touched. 

Babbage attempted to show how mathematics and computational thinking could help to reveal the nature of the divine in the organisations of the cosmos, which was incredibly ahead of its time in 1837. Babbage even became close to painting a picture of God as a computer programme; *a divine being with a cosmic machine that set the universe in motion.* The wider argument contains ideas such as his discussion of movements and sounds imprinted within the atoms of the atmosphere surrounding us.
